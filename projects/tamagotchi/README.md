# Tomogatchi

I spelled tamagotchi wrong but let's just ignore that. I built this tamagotchi game for a mini project in my Web Development immersive at GA.

Right now nothing is styled that well and it's not perfect, but the functionality is there and it has some nice features.

You can see your levels increase, keep a simple tomogatchi alive, etc. I used svg elements along with jquery to create this game!
